# smartwatch-data-analysis

Problem statement :
    By using data analyse and understand the relationship between total no. of steps walked a day by user and calories burned in single day.
    
Approch to solve problem statement :
    -First we will start with importing important libraries then import the dataset and convert it into dataframe for EDA.
    -For understanding and anaylsing dataset its very important its should be cleaned. 
    -Cleaned dataset means there is no missing values, not any spelling mistakes in columns and most important its should be labelled.
    -We will perform EDA to clean our dataset. for missing values we can fill them using mean , mode or medium ,for any spelling mistakes we will use pre-defined replace() function.
    -After clean dataset we will use visualization tool (matplotlib) to see graphical representation of data to understand data easily.
    -Our main objective is find out the relationship between total steps walked and total calories burned in single day.
    -For this we will use scatter plot to see relationship between them.
    -If no. of steps is incresed and also no. calories burned incresed then we can say there is strong relationship between them.
    -On the basis of  this relationship we can predict the steps for required calories burn.
    -This will help user to take care of their fitness.
